# DNArchive - The community curated DNA archive - v0.01 alpha

A DNA sequence repository for easy, open-access and community based curation.

## Description

DNArchive aims to simplify the retrieval of DNA sequences used commonly in genetic engineering. It is particularily well suited for part level accessions (for ease of sequence retrieval), but also capable of dealing with composite level constructs.
